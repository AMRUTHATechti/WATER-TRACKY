# WATER-TRACKY
# Problem Statement
According to many surveys,the general consensus is that adults should drink between 2.5 and 4.5 litres of water per day. In our current scenario people are not able to satisfy this need.So people need a reminder to make them aware of the importance of the same.
# Solution
We created a web application where the user can log their water intake and body dimensions(height,weight) and reciecve reminders to drink water at regular intervals.The application should also display statistics such as daily,weekly and monthly water intake summaries.
